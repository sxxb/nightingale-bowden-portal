# What is "Strata"?
A Strata Corporation, or Strata, is the term for a group of housing units that share common property. The Strata Corporation allows for the housing units to be owned by their individual owners, and the common property (such as the rooftop garden, the lift, the walkways, the stairwell, and the building exterior) to be owned, managed and funded collectively. The Strata Corporation also sets rules (known as articles) that members of the Strata Corporation must follow.

The management of the Strata Corporation is delegated to the Committee, comprised of unit owners.

# What does a Strata Manager do?
A Strata Manager is a professional who assists the Committee in managing the Strata Corporation. Most Committee members do not have the time or expertise to manage a Strata Corporation, so much of the bureaucratic work (such as organising repairs & maintenance, preparing financial statements, organising insurance etc.) is delegated to the Strata Manager, while the Committee retains decision-making power.

# What are Strata levies for?
Strata levies ensure the Strata Corporation has funds available to ensure the common property is managed effectively. They also pay for the Strata Manager's fees.

In practice, members of a Strata Corporation pay levies into two different funds:
1. Admin Fund
2. Sinking Fund

The **Admin Fund** is used for annual expenses. This includes cleaning, gardening, insurance, maintenance, and other regular, ongoing expenses.

The **Sinking Fund** is used for long term expenses, which may or may not be foreseable. Examples could include replacing solar panels at the end of their life span, addressing urgent structural issues, or funding improvements to the building that are have been planned far in advance.

# What kind of rules can a Strata Corporation impose?
Generally, the rules (known as articles) relate to being a good neighbour; keeping your lot in good condition, not obstructing common areas, not being disruptive to other lot owners, and so on.
